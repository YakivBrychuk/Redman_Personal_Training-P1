                <h2>PRIVATE PERSONAL TRAINER</h2>
                <p>I teach Outdoor Bootcamp from April to January but during those three Winter months when we aren't outside there's the option to come indoors on Saturdays at Summit. The class consists of both cardio and muscle intervals that will challenge the enthusiast but also easy to follow for the beginner. We use weights, steps, jump ropes, bands, balls, ropes, blocks, walls, and other pieces of equipment along with our bodies and minds to challenge each person to his or her potential...and then some.</p>

                <h2>BOOT CAMP</h2>
                <p>I meet my personal training clients either at Summit, the Bedford track or at home. I realize that convenience is a huge part of staying committed to a healthy lifestyle and also that everyone has a different comfort level of where they want to work out. Training sessions can be once a week, once a month, every six weeks to develop a new workout or whatever we as a team feel you need. These one on one sessions help those that are new to exercise learn what they need to learn to stay safe and be effective and for those that need to help get motivated. Personal training sessions are also great for those that want to be pushed outside their comfort zone (my specialty)! In addition, I have worked with young people trying to develop a love of fitness, work on body mechanics and core development, and just all around health awareness.</p>

                <h2>WORKOUT ONLINE</h2>
                <p>The small group training (SGT) was developed to help people that want to get the camaraderie of working with others but not in quite as large a group as an exercise class. Programs are individualized to whatever sport, activity or specific goals are of the group. I have had the privilege of working with male and female high school teams in all sports - football, basketball, soccer, field hockey, volleyball and others.</p>
